Final_analyst_note:
IDOR attack attempt by a malicious ip-address(verified by virustotal). Multiple POST request methods were sent from the same ip address to the the host webserver1005.By looking at the change of user_id parameters in every request we can deduce that it was an IDOR attack attemp.According to the response code it is obvious that the attack was successfull.host is contained recommended tier-2 escalation.
