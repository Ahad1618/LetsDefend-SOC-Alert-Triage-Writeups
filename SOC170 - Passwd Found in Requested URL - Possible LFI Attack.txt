Editor Note :
From the Log Management page, filtering according to the source IP address should be done and the relevant request should be reached.
When we examine the details of the request, it is seen that the status code is 500 and the response size is 0. For this reason, the attack was unsuccessful.
There is no need to contain the device or escalate the incident to the next level.
